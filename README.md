# Comparing and Visualizing New York Times coverage of Presidents Obama and Trump

# Project Motivation: 
In this mini-project, we used the article search API provided by the New York Times to pull data for articles related to Presidents Obama and Trump. Our queries looked at comparable time frames, which we decided would be a two-year period starting from 6 months before taking office. This allowed us to consider the (current) entirety of the Trump Administration, and yielded nearly 6000 articles to work with! We hope you enjoy looking through our visualizations of this data.
